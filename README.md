# industry-bullshit

Bullshit phrases used in the web industry. 

### Phrases, not single words

Bullshit needs context. While a lot of words might seem like bullshit in and of themselves, for this list to be any use we need that context. So "utilize"--a terrible word--is not bullshit but the phrase "going forward" certainly is.
